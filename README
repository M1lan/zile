INTRODUCTION
============

GNU Zi is a lightweight text editor. Every [Emacs][] user should feel at
home with Zi. Zi is aimed at small footprint systems and quick editing
sessions (it starts up and shuts down instantly).

Zi is written in Lua 5.2 using POSIX APIs, and hence requires a Lua
5.2 runtime and a few additional Lua modules:

 * Lua stdlib <https://github.com/rrthomas/lua-stdlib>
 * Lua BitOp <http://bitop.luajit.org/>
 * lrexlib <http://rrthomas.github.com/lrexlib/>
   (the rex_gnu module must be built)
 * luaposix <https://github.com/luaposix/luaposix>
   (the curses module must be built)
 * alien <http://mascarenhas.github.com/alien/>

For exact version dependencies, see `src/loadlua.lua.in`. These are
most easily installed using [LuaRocks][].

Source Layout
-------------

 * See file `AUTHORS` for the names of maintainers past and present.
 * See file `COPYING` for copying conditions.
 * See file `FAQ` for a selection of a Frequently Answered Questions.
 * See file `INSTALL` for generic compilation and installation
   instructions.
 * See file `NEWS` for a list of major changes in each Zi release.
 * See file `THANKS` for a list of important contributors.

The rest of the files in the top-level directory are part of the
[Autotools]() build system used to compile and install Zi.

 * Directory `build-aux` contains helper scripts used to build Zi.
 * Directory `doc` contains files used to create Zi's documentation.
 * Directory `m4` contains a mixture of [gnulib]() supplied and Zi-
   specific macros for rebuilding the `configure' script.
 * Directory `src` contains the source code used to build Zi.
 * Directory `tests` contains a suite of tests used by `make check` to
   sanity check a newly built `src/zi` binary.

Web Pages
---------

GNU Zi's home page is at:

  > <http://www.gnu.org/s/zile/>

GNU Zi development is co-ordinated from Zile's project page at GNU
Savannah:

  > <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/zile/>

An archive of past releases is also archived at:

  > <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/zile/>

But please use a mirror for faster downloads and to reduce stress on the
main GNU machine. The following link will automatically redirect to a
nearest mirror:

  > <http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/zile/>

Or you can manually select a mirror from the list at:

  > <http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html>


Mailing Lists
-------------

Questions, comments and requests should be sent to the Zile user's list
at <help-zile@gnu.org>.

See [REPORTING BUGS][] for the bug reporting mailing list address.


OBTAINING THE LATEST SOURCES
============================

If you are just building GNU Zi from an [Official Release][], you
should not normally need to run `./bootstrap` or `autoreconf`; just go
ahead and start with `./configure`.

If you are trying to build GNU Zi from the [Development Sources][],
`./configure` will not work until the `./bootstrap` script has completed
successfully.


Official Release
----------------

Compressed tarballs of all recent GNU Zi releases are available from:

  > <http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/zile>

Compressed tarballs of unstable prereleases are sometimes made available
from:

  > <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/zile>

Official tarballs are supplied with a [GnuPG][] detached signature file
so that you can verify that the corresponding tarball is still the same
file that was released by the owner of its GPG key ID. First, be sure to
download both the .sig file and the corresponding release:

    wget http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/zile/zi-1.7.tar.gz
    wget http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/zile/zi-1.7.tar.gz.sig

then run a command like this:

    gpg --verify zi-1.7.tar.gz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:

    gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 80EE4A00

and then rerun the `gpg --verify' command.

Generic instructions for how to build GNU Zi from a release tarball
are contained in the file `INSTALL`.

If you are missing any of the prerequisite libraries needed to
successfully build GNU Zi, the `configure` script will abort itself
and tell you right away.

Development Sources
-------------------

Zi development sources are maintained at the GNU Savannah git server:

  > [git://git.sv.gnu.org/zile.git][gitbrowser]

You can fetch a read-only copy with either:

    git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/zile.git

or using the CVS pserver protocol:

    cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@pserver.git.sv.gnu.org:/srv/git/zile.git \
        co -d zile HEAD

If you are behind a firewall that blocks the git protocol, you can force
git to transparently rewrite all savannah references to use http:

    git config --global url.http://git.sv.gnu.org/r/.insteadof \
        git://git.sv.gnu.org/

When you are building GNU Zi from a git checkout, you first need to
run the `bootstrap` script to generate various files that are shipped in
release tarballs, but not checked in to git.

Normally, you just need to run `./bootstrap`, and it will either get
everything ready so that you can then run `./configure` as would for a
release tarball, or else tell you if your machine is missing some
packages that it needs in order to do that. One of the first things that
`bootstrap` will do the first time you run it in a freshly cloned git
tree is to clone a copy of [gnulib][] as a submodule. If you already
have an up-to-date [gnulib][] clone on your machine, you can save the
time and bandwidth of downloading it again by using `--gnulib-srcdir` to
point at your existing gnulib directory:

    ./bootstrap --gnulib-srcdir=/path/to/existing/gnulib/checkout/

With a copy of gnulib now installed as a submodule, if you wish, you can
continue to work off-line by passing `--skip-git` to rerun the
`bootstrap` script, otherwise subsequent `bootstrap` runs will refresh
the contents of the submodule:

    ./bootstrap --skip-git

REPORTING BUGS
==============

If this distribution doesn't work for you, before you report the
problem, please try upgrading to the latest released version first, to
see whether your issue has been fixed already. If you can, please also
check whether the latest development sources for the next release still
exhibit the problem (see [OBTAINING THE LATEST SOURCES][] above).

Please send bug reports, feature requests and patches to
<bug-zile@gnu.org> or, preferably, file them directly in the relevant
tracker at <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/zile/>.

When you are ready to submit a report, first, please read this:

  > <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html>

Zi has a suite of tests in the tests directory of the source
distribution, which you can run with:

    make check

If, when you report a bug, you can create a similar test that
demonstrates it, the maintainers will be most grateful, and it will
prevent them from accidentally reintroducing the bug in a subsequent
release.
