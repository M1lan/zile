1 Functionality

1.1 Some keys don't work (e.g. `C-h' does backspace).

    The terminfo entry for your terminal type is probably incorrect.
    Rebuilding Zi against the latest ncurses may help.

    With Mac OS X, Terminal.app outputs different escape sequences
    than described by the xterm-color terminfo entry. Make sure you
    have the default terminal type preference set to xterm-256color,
    or else run Zi with:

        TERM=xterm-256color zi

1.2 The META/ALT key doesn't work in xterm.

    This is probably because you are using "8-bit input".
    Using the following X resources should make things work:

      XTerm*eightBitInput: false
      UXTerm*eightBitInput: false

    Typically you'll want to put these lines in your ~/.Xresources
    file.

1.3 How do I handle non-ASCII characters?

    Zi uses the operating system's locale support, so you need to
    set an appropriate locale; how you do this depends on your OS.
    However, Zi only works with 8-bit locales.

2 General questions

2.1 What does `Zi' mean?

    It is descended from GNU Zile, with the Lisp Engine remove, hence
    `Zi'.

2.2 Zi is weird!

    Zi was written to be as small and simple as possible. If you
    don't like it, it might be because it doesn't work the way you're
    used to, or it may have been badly designed. If after trying it
    for a bit you still don't like the way it works, please tell us
    what you don't like (see the README for the address).

2.3 Why another clone of Emacs?  Why not just use Emacs?

    Like Zile, Zi is a small, portable Emacs for systems and situations
    in which Emacs would be unsuitable, including small systems and
    quick editing sessions. Unlike Zile, Zi doesn't try to work just
    like Emacs, so that it can be even better at being small and
    portable. For example, Zi does not support Emacs Lisp; instead,
    you can configure and extend it using the Lua language.

2.4 I like the xyz function of Emacs but it's not in Zi!

    Zi was written to be small but fast and powerful enough.

    In general, if you need something more powerful, use Emacs. You
    could also try Jed, which emulates Emacs, is not much bigger than
    Zi, and has syntax highlighting, a macro language and more
    (http://www.jedsoft.org/jed/).

    If you still think that a certain function should be implemented
    in Zi, please send a message to the developers (see question
    2.7).

2.5 Does Zi support Unicode/UTF-8?

    No.
