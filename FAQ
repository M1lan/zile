1 Functionality

1.1 Some keys don't work (e.g. `C-h' does backspace).

    The terminfo entry for your terminal type is probably incorrect.
    Rebuilding Zee against the latest ncurses may help.

    With Mac OS X, Terminal.app outputs different escape sequences
    than described by the xterm-color terminfo entry. Make sure you
    have the default terminal type preference set to xterm-256color,
    or else run Zee with:

        TERM=xterm-256color zee

1.2 The META/ALT key doesn't work in xterm.

    This is probably because you are using "8-bit input".
    Using the following X resources should make things work:

      XTerm*eightBitInput: false
      UXTerm*eightBitInput: false

    Typically you'll want to put these lines in your ~/.Xresources
    file.

1.3 How do I handle non-ASCII characters?

    Zee uses the operating system's locale support, so you need to
    set an appropriate locale; how you do this depends on your OS.
    However, Zee only works with 8-bit locales.

2 General questions

2.1 What does `Zee' mean?

    It's a short name related to `Zile', the name of the editor from
    which Zee is descended.

2.2 Does Zee support Unicode/UTF-8?

    No, but this is planned.
