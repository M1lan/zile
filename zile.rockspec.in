      GNU Zile is a lightweight Emacs clone. Zile is short for Zile Is
      Lossy Emacs. Zile has been written to be as similar as possible
      to Emacs; every Emacs user should feel at home.

      Zile has all of Emacs's basic editing features: it is 8-bit
      clean (though it currently lacks Unicode support), and the
      number of editing buffers and windows is only limited by
      available memory and screen space respectively. Registers,
      minibuffer completion and auto fill are available. Function and
      variable names are identical with Emacs's.
